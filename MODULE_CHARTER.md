letsA(ppl)I — Module Charter (draft)

Problem this module helps with
Job searching creates decision paralysis due to information overload and excessive self-filtering. Reviewing listings and judging “am I good enough?” becomes a bottleneck that prevents action. This module reduces that burden by narrowing the search space and surfacing plausible opportunities based on user-provided information.

What this module does

Finds newly posted job opportunities from job boards and selected company career pages

Prioritizes roles based on recency and relevance to user-provided materials

Guides the user through application preparation steps

Drafts resume and cover letter variations based on job listings

Surfaces potential LinkedIn or prior-work connections related to a company

Drafts outreach messages for referrals or informational conversations

Prompts the user to identify additional connections not captured automatically

What this module does NOT do

Does not automatically submit applications

Does not apply indiscriminately

Does not decide what roles the user should want

Does not present unrealistic options as recommendations

Does not impersonate the user or act on their behalf

How a human stays in control
The user reviews all job listings, chooses whether to apply, edits all materials, and sends all applications and messages themselves.

When v1 is “done enough”
When the module reliably surfaces same-day job postings and provides clear guidance for preparing application materials.

Relationship to applyAI
This module is a standalone application-support tool that applies applyAI’s principles and may later become the first applied module of the applyAI platform.
