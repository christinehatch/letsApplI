# Chat-Style Discovery & Alignment Flow
*(UX Design Document)*

## First-Run Experience

When a user opens letsA(ppl)I for the first time:

> “What kinds of roles or domains are you interested in exploring?”

Options:
- Select domains (AI, backend, data, design)
- Select companies
- Or both

No resume required.

---

## Discovery Phase (Passive)

System behavior:
- Subscribes to discovery signals
- Monitors indexes
- Detects new roles

User sees:
> “New role discovered at Adobe: Data Engineer”

No judgment. No ranking.

---

## Engagement Phase (User-Led)

User clicks a role.

System responds:
> “I can help you align your experience with this role.  
> To do that, I need to see the job description.”

Options:
- “Fetch details”
- “I’ll paste it myself”
- “Skip for now”

---

## Alignment Phase (Phase 5)

Once hydrated:
- Deterministic gap surfacing runs
- AI proposals are optional and gated
- Everything remains provisional

---

## Resume Construction Mode

If no resume exists:
- System asks concrete memory-sparking questions
- Captures verified experience
- Locks meaning before wording

If resume exists:
- System performs evidence alignment
- Proposes wording changes only

---

## Guiding UX Principle

> The system never asks the user to invent experience.  
> It only helps them **recognize and articulate what already exists**.

---

## Explicit UX Non-Goals

- No “recommended jobs”
- No scoring
- No urgency pressure
- No automation without consent

The UI feels conversational, but the system remains **structurally conservative**.
