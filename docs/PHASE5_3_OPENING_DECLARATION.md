# Phase 5.3 — Opening Declaration

**Fit Analysis (Non-Prescriptive)**

**Status:** Formally Open
**Opened On:** 2026-01-25
**Preceded By:** Phase 5.2 — Interpretation (Locked)
**Governing Inputs:**

* `PHASE5_2_OUTPUT_LOCK.md`
* Explicit user intent to analyze fit

---

## 0. Declaration

Phase 5.3 is hereby **formally opened**.

Phase 5.3 is the **first phase** in letsA(ppl)I where the system is permitted to:

> **Relate interpreted job requirements to user-provided information**

This phase introduces **fit analysis**, but **not advice**.

---

## 1. Purpose of Phase 5.3

Phase 5.3 exists solely to:

* Compare **interpreted job artifacts** (from Phase 5.2)
* Against **explicit user-provided data** (resume, skills, experience)
* And surface **structured alignment signals**

Phase 5.3 does **not**:

* Decide outcomes
* Recommend actions
* Optimize resumes
* Predict success
* Encourage or discourage applications

It answers **“how things line up”**, not **“what you should do.”**

---

## 2. Authority Boundary

Phase 5.3 is granted authority to:

* Perform comparative analysis between:

  * Phase 5.2 interpretation artifacts
  * User-supplied, consented inputs
* Identify:

  * Matches
  * Gaps
  * Ambiguities
* Express findings in **descriptive, neutral language**

Phase 5.3 is **not** granted authority to:

* Judge candidate quality
* Score likelihood of hiring
* Rank the user against others
* Advise application strategy
* Modify or generate user materials
* Persist conclusions as preferences

---

## 3. Consent Requirements

Phase 5.3 may activate **only if**:

* Phase 5.2 output exists and is valid
* The user explicitly requests **fit analysis**
* The user explicitly provides or selects the data to be analyzed

Implicit analysis is forbidden.

If consent is missing or ambiguous:

**Phase 5.3 must not run.**

---

## 4. Output Nature

Phase 5.3 outputs are:

* **Analytical**
* **Descriptive**
* **Non-prescriptive**
* **Non-evaluative**

Allowed output examples:

* “The job lists X; the resume mentions Y.”
* “This requirement is not addressed in the provided material.”
* “Some overlap exists, but phrasing differs.”

Forbidden output examples:

* “You are a strong candidate.”
* “You should improve this section.”
* “This role is a good fit.”
* “You are missing critical skills.”

---

## 5. Relationship to Other Phases

Phase 5.3:

* **Consumes** Phase 5.2 interpretation output
* **Consumes** user-provided materials
* **May feed** Phase 5.4+ (resume refinement, guidance)
  **only with new consent**

Phase 5.3 **does not unlock** downstream phases automatically.

---

## 6. Invariants

While Phase 5.3 is active:

* Analysis ≠ recommendation
* Gaps ≠ deficiencies
* Matches ≠ endorsements
* Comparison ≠ judgment
* Insight ≠ instruction

Any violation is a **design failure**, not a UX issue.

---

## 7. Summary

Phase 5.3 introduces a powerful but constrained capability:

**Seeing alignment — without telling the user what it means.**

This phase exists to support reflection,
not to replace human judgment.

**Phase 5.3 is now open.**
