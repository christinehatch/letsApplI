# Phase 5.2 — Output Contract Lock

**Phase:** 5.2 — Interpretation  
**Locked On:** 2026-01-25  
**Status:** LOCKED — Binding and Non-Extensible  

---

## Lock Declaration

The Phase 5.2 Interpretation Output Contract is hereby **locked**.

This lock affirms that:

- `PHASE5_2_OUTPUT_CONTRACT.md` defines the **complete and exclusive**
  output authority of Phase 5.2
- No additional fields, claims, inferences, or semantics may be added
  without opening a new phase
- Interpretation output is **non-prescriptive**, **non-evaluative**, and
  **non-actionable**

---

## Enforced Constraints

Phase 5.2 output **must not**:

- Recommend actions
- Evaluate user fit
- Rank importance
- Compare jobs
- Imply seniority, desirability, or priority
- Assert unstated facts

Any such behavior constitutes **phase leakage**.

---

## Authority Boundary

Phase 5.2 is authorized to produce:

> Structured descriptions of what a job posting explicitly states.

Nothing more.

All downstream meaning, judgment, or action requires:
- A later phase
- Explicit user consent
- A new output contract

---

## Enforcement

- All Phase 5.2 implementations must conform to this lock
- Violations are **design failures**, not bugs
- This lock may only be superseded by a formal phase declaration

---

## Final Statement

**Interpretation is not advice.  
Structure is not judgment.  
Phase 5.2 authority ends here.**
