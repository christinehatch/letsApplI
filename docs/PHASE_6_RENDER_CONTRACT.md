# PHASE_6_RENDER_CONTRACT.md

## Controlled Exposure of Phase 5.2 Interpretation

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the rendering constraints for Phase 5.2 interpretation results within Phase 6 UI.

Rendering must:

- Preserve analytical authority boundaries
- Prevent UI-authored interpretation
- Prevent advisory drift
- Prevent semantic mutation
- Prevent priority distortion

**Phase 6 renders.**

**Phase 5.2 interprets.**

That boundary is absolute.

---

## 2. Rendering Authority Model

### Phase 5.2 Owns:

- Analytical synthesis
- Neutral explanatory text
- Capability framing
- Requirement clustering
- Modality classification
- Thematic emphasis structure

### Phase 6 Owns:

- Consent gating
- State transitions
- Scoped execution
- Structural projection of schema fields

### Phase 6 must not:

- Add interpretation
- Add summary
- Add commentary
- Add coaching
- Add prescriptive framing
- Add second-person language
- Rephrase schema fields
- Collapse structural sections

---

## 3. Rendering Rule (Core Invariant)

> Render schema-authored text fields verbatim.
> Do not generate, summarize, reinterpret, or augment those fields in the UI layer.

If a text string did not originate from validated Phase 5.2 output, it must not appear in interpretation display.

---

## 4. Allowed Rendering Transformations

### UI may:

- Map schema fields to visual containers
- Display section headers defined in schema
- Use whitespace and layout styling
- Group unordered arrays for usability (if schema marks them unordered)
- Apply neutral typography

### UI may not:

- Reorder semantically ranked fields
- Highlight specific capabilities
- Add visual weighting implying importance
- Insert connective narrative text
- Generate derived summaries
- Compute counts and label them meaningfully (e.g., "Top 3 themes")
- Collapse sections into new composites

---

## 5. Ordering Semantics

Each array field in Phase 5.2 schema must declare:

```
ordering_semantics:
  - semantic_ranked
  - source_order
  - unordered
```

### Rendering behavior:

- `semantic_ranked` → preserve order strictly
- `source_order` → preserve order strictly
- `unordered` → UI may reorder for usability only

### Reordering must not:

- Change labels
- Imply priority
- Combine categories
- Alter grouping semantics

---

## 6. Text Rendering Constraints

### Allowed:

- Analytical prose generated by Phase 5.2
- Neutral explanatory phrasing
- Structured descriptive sentences

### Forbidden:

- "This means…"
- "You should…"
- "This role would be good for…"
- "Candidates typically…"
- "Strong applicants…"

No second-person language.
No probabilistic hiring language.
No evaluation language.
No coaching layer.

---

## 7. No Derived Interpretation

UI must not compute:

- Emphasis weight
- Skill importance ranking
- Readiness signals
- Fit likelihood
- Skill gaps
- Resume alignment hints
- Action suggestions
- Project recommendations

Even if computable from schema.

**Phase 6 is not an analytical surface.**

---

## 8. Rendering Structure (Minimal Surface)

When `state === INTERPRETED`, render only:

- Role Summary (schema field)
- Requirements Analysis (schema section)
- Capability Domains (schema section)
- Project Opportunity Signals (if included in schema)
- Modality Distribution (if included in schema)

Each section must map 1:1 to schema keys.

No extra sections.
No derived sections.

---

## 9. Revocation Rendering Rule

On `REVOKE_INTERPRETATION`:

- Immediately clear rendered interpretation
- Unmount interpretation container
- Remove interpretation data from memory

Hydration display may remain.

Interpretation must not persist visually or in state.

---

## 10. No Hidden Persistence

Interpretation data:

- Must not be cached in localStorage
- Must not auto-restore on page refresh
- Must not auto-regenerate
- Must not persist without explicit new consent

If page reload occurs:

- Return to `HYDRATED` state.
- Interpretation requires new consent.

---

## 11. Anti-Drift Enforcement Strategy

Add automated test:

- Render component with mock `Phase52Result`
- Assert no UI-generated strings exist outside schema fields
- Assert no second-person language present in render tree
- Assert no extra sections rendered
- Assert ordering respected based on `ordering_semantics`

Rendering must be testable and diff-detectable.

---

## 12. Non-Goals (Explicit)

This render layer does **NOT**:

- Provide chat
- Provide coaching
- Provide fit scoring
- Provide resume integration
- Provide automation suggestions
- Provide project recommendations beyond schema-defined neutral signals
- Provide prioritization indicators

**Interpretation exposure only.**

---

## Architectural Integrity Statement

> The rendering layer is a projection surface, not a reasoning surface.

All analytical authority resides in Phase 5.2.

All consent authority resides in Phase 6.

No new intelligence exists in the UI.
