# letsA(ppl)I — V1 Infrastructure Checklist

Purpose: Prove the system architecture before adding complexity.

- [x] Replace fake job data with a source adapter
- [x] Prove multiple source adapters compose cleanly
- [x] Preserve prioritization logic without refactors
- [x] Preserve stable, human-readable daily output
- [x] Demonstrate a clear stop point (V1.1 complete)

V1 is considered demo-complete at this point.
