# letsA(ppl)I — Project Phases

This document defines the **intentional, finite phases** of letsA(ppl)I.

Each phase is:
- independently valuable
- demoable on its own
- explicitly scoped to avoid automation creep

This is not a promise of future work.  
It is a **map for disciplined exploration**.

---

## Phase 0 — Output Contract & Rules (COMPLETE)

**Purpose:**  
Prove that job prioritization can be done using **explicit, inspectable rules**, producing a human-readable daily output.

**What exists:**
- A deterministic prioritization model (High / Medium / Low)
- Clear, explainable reasons for why each job appears
- A generated `DAILY_OUTPUT.md` artifact

**Explicitly not included:**
- No scraping
- No AI / LLMs
- No personalization
- No automation

**Completion criteria:**  
A stable output format that humans can reason about without trusting a black box.

---

## Phase 1 — Real Inputs via Source Adapters (COMPLETE)

**Purpose:**  
Prove the system can accept **realistic inputs** without modifying core logic.

### Phase 1.0
- Replace fake job data with a single source adapter

### Phase 1.1
- Compose multiple source adapters
- Preserve the same output contract and prioritization logic

**What exists:**
- Source adapters as isolated modules
- Composition of multiple sources via simple concatenation
- No refactors to prioritization or formatting code

**Completion criteria:**  
Adding a new source means *adding a file*, not changing the system.

---

## Phase 2 — Deterministic “Same-Day” Detection (COMPLETE)

**Purpose:**  
Make “new today” an **explicit, explainable concept**, not an assumption.

**What may be added:**
- Deterministic recency rules (timestamps, feed order, known refresh patterns)
- Clear explanation in output of *how* recency was determined

**Explicitly not included:**
- No background jobs
- No schedulers
- No heuristics without explanation

**Completion criteria:**  
Humans can understand *why* a job is considered new, even when it’s wrong.

---

## Phase 3 — Real Data Ingestion (Read-Only)

**Purpose:**  
Transition from simulated inputs to **one real, verifiable data source** without changing core logic or introducing automation.

**What may be added:**
- A single real website adapter (e.g., one company careers page)
- Read-only data fetching
- Clean mapping into the existing adapter contract
- Explicit compliance with robots.txt and ToS

**Explicitly not included:**
- No persistence
- No background jobs
- No posting-date inference
- No ranking logic inside adapters

**Completion criteria:**  
A real job source appears in `DAILY_OUTPUT.md` using the same rules and explanations as demo data.

---

## Phase 4 — State & Memory

**Purpose:**  
Improve accuracy of “first seen” detection by persisting previously observed jobs across runs.

**What may be added:**
- Local persistence (JSON or SQLite)
- Stable mapping of `{source, source_job_id → first_seen_at}`
- Deterministic rehydration of state

**Explicitly not included:**
- No ML or prediction
- No personalization
- No inferred preferences

**Completion criteria:**  
“New today” remains accurate across restarts and repeated runs.

---

## Phase 5 — Guided Human Actions

**Purpose:**  
Reduce cognitive load **after** jobs are surfaced, without automating decisions.

**Explicit non-goals:**
- Full automation
- Personality inference
- Resume scoring
- Hiring decisions
- “AI that knows you better than you know yourself”

**Completion criteria:**  
Further work would require a new charter and a new name.

## Current Status

- Phase 0: ✅ Complete
- Phase 1: ✅ Complete
- Phase 2: ✅ Complete
- Phase 3: 🚧 Planned, not committed

This project is considered **demo-complete after Phase 1**.
